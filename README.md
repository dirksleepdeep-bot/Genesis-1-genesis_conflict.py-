## 4. Variant Experiment: Genesis-1 (Internal Friction)
## 变体实验：Genesis-1（内在撕裂/精神内耗）

I ran a control group (Normal) vs. a test group (Conflicted) of 100 entities each.
**The result is devastating:**

| Entity Type | Environment | Avg Lifespan | Cause of Death |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | Random | **~620 steps** | Natural entropy |
| **Conflicted** | Mutually Exclusive | **~280 steps** | **Internal Friction** |

### The Logic of Friction / 内耗的逻辑
In `genesis_conflict.py`, the entity is born with a **"Cursed Personality"**: it desires both `Symmetry` (Order) and `Novelty` (Chaos) at extreme levels.
However, the environment is programmed with a **Mutually Exclusive constraint** (`High Symmetry implies Low Novelty`).

### Observed Phenomena / 观察到的现象
1.  **Extreme Early Death**: Lifespan is cut in half. The entity burns out rapidly not because the world is empty, but because **its desires are geometrically impossible to satisfy**.
2.  **The "Bipolar" Oscillation**: In later stages, the entity oscillates wildly between choosing high symmetry and high novelty, never finding peace.
3.  **Conclusion**: This simulates "Mental Friction" (精神内耗). The entity dies from the inability to reconcile its own internal contradictions.

**To run this variant:**
`python genesis_conflict.py`
